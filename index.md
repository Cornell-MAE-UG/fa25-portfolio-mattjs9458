## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a junior mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with an aerospace engineering minor. I am passionate about applying physical and mathematical models to analyze real-world systems and improve design, performance, and reliability. My coursework in dynamic systems and control, mechanical design, material analysis, and spaceflight mechanics has given me a strong analytical and technical foundation, while my experience as a physics electromagnetism teaching assistant has strengthened my ability to convey complex, technical concepts and collaborate effectively with others.
As the dynamics subteam lead of the Cornell Seismic Design project team, I guide the design, testing, and analysis of a vibrational mechanical damping system for our competition structure while helping new members learn tools such as MATLAB, Fusion 360, Fourier Analysis, and vibrational modal analysis in weekly meetings. I also have gained professional engineering experience as a mechanical engineering intern at an HVAC engineering firm, assisting in the design of HVAC systems for both commercial and mission critical environments.
