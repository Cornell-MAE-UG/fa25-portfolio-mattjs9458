For this project I worked in a group of four students to design a backpack attachment that lets skiers carry their skis and boots on a standard backpack in a safer and more comfortable way. The system uses a backboard with wooden gears, a pair of “fake boot” mounts that mimic a ski binding interface, and ratchet straps that secure the whole assembly to the backpack. The user clips each ski into the fake boot parts just as they would step into a ski binding, locks the slider to match their ski length, then tightens the straps to attach everything to the pack. A geared locking mechanism lets the user rotate and fix the skis in different positions while the system is on their back.

We began with hand sketches and quick concept discussions and multiple interviews to understand how skiers actually carry their equipment and where current solutions fall short. From there we converged on a modular backboard-and-gear concept and built it in Fusion 360, which we used both for detailed modeling and for the render that appears in my portfolio. CAD let us tune clearances, set the ski interface geometry, and place hardware in a way that would survive real loads. We then fabricated the prototype with laser cut wood, 3D printed binding components, and off-the-shelf hardware, followed by an intensive round of weight, drop, and impact tests. The prototype was able to carry more load than our initial target and stayed functional under repeated abuse, so it served as a strong proof of concept, which is visible in the attached photos and full report [here]({{ "assets/ODP 7_ Final Report (1).pdf" | relative_url }}).

Throughout this process we tried to design not just for function but for manufacturing and assembly. We compared options such as CNC routing, jigs, and injection molding, and concluded that an injection molded ski boot attachment in glass-filled nylon, combined with laser cut wooden or composite backboards, would give a good balance of cost, durability, and speed at scale. To support consistent assembly we added 0.05 inch grooves and guides into the gears, mounts, and strap interfaces, so assemblers would be forced to place parts in exactly the right locations. We also standardized cylindrical rod diameters to match common stock sizes, which reduces the need for custom machining and simplifies both sourcing and quality control.

Design for sustainability and serviceability was also a major focus. Our analysis using the 2030 Calculator showed that PLA parts and epoxy were both large contributors to environmental impact and also made the product hard to repair, since glued joints prevent disassembly. In response we proposed switching to recycled ABS or PETG, relying on mechanical fasteners or snap fits instead of epoxy, and organizing the product into three main modules: the central backboard and the left and right boot mounts. We also redesigned the fake boot attachments and strap anchors to bolt on, so users can replace high-wear parts with basic tools rather than discarding the whole system. Together these decisions make the product easier to manufacture, easier to assemble, more sustainable over its life, and more practical to service as outdoor use takes its toll.
