As a member of Cornell Seismic Design, I was heavily involved in the design, construction, testing, and analysis of a cable dampening system for the 5-ft tall balsa wood structure. In order to reduce the amplitude and velocity of our building's oscillations, we implemented cross-body cables on each face of the building that went into tension, pulling the building back to its equilibrium position when the building was shaken under a simulated earthquake.

Besides the springs and the cables, all of the damper's parts were designed and manufactured using Autodesk Fusion 360. These models were then 3D printed and implemented into the building. I conducted all of the Fusion modeling, and renders of the design can be found in the attached damper proposal. The design, testing, and analysis process was documented in a damper proposal sent to the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) for review and approval in our competition, and it is attached [here]({{ "assets/CornellUniversityDamperProposal2025 (1).pdf" | relative_url }}).

In addition to the damper, I was also involved in the structural design process. Every year, the EERI provides a the architectural plans for the building, which include designated "no-build" zones. These zones create unique structural design challenges for the compeition. For example, last year's building featured a multi-story hole running diagonally through the building, introducing torsional concerns due to the structure's asymmetry along the shaking axis. Our structural design approach accounted for these challenges through the incorporation of a diagrid on each face. More information about the structural design, geotechnical site analysis, and ground motion selection can be found in our team's proposal [here]({{ "assets/Cornell University SDC 2025 Proposal.pdf" | relative_url }}).
